It is easy to assemble, the breaks are very nice and the body of the bycicle has a good quality overall.
Well we've had multiple problems with the derailleurs not shifting properly or shifting rough which isn't exactly safe for a kid's bike and the bike shop can't get them adjusted right.
The handlebars sit way too low. The gears suck. They will not change appropriately and if you are caught in mid-gear, good luck trying to get it to gear up or down.
The 29 inch wheels just mean that your feet will hit them every time you try to turn at low speeds.
It has held up quite well and is a solid bike given the price range
very happy , but had to fix the cables , they had them around the neck the wrong way
I ordered this bike a week ago and have regretted it since.
Bought it for my wife, she loves this bike.
I realize many have had no issues with their purchase, but the first bike and the replacement bike came with severe issues for us.
It went together easily in less than an hour. Make sure the front fork is forward or the pedals will hit the front tire
