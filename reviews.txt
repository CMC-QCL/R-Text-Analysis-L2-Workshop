Boring and too much singing /
A very well produced film. The effects, acting, dancing, and singing were superb. A little out there, but wonderful 
this move suck and you can not even tell what they are singing a major disappointment and my expectations was not high to begin with 
I was so ready for it to be over. I guess this was one that should have been left to Broadway @
Same great music as the play - wonderful star performances- beautiful special effects
Weird- cockroaches with faces /
It was entertaining, maybe a bit too long though 
Total disaster. Just got out of it, couldnâ€™t stand staying till the end 
Tom Hooper should not direct musicals \
Great singing, choreography & special effects 
it was better than I thought or expected especially for a musical 
It was beautiful and stunning. My favorite part was the tap number outstanding 
Boring storyline and way too much dancing \
Really enjoyed the movie
The CGI effect was terrible /
Movie was okay  @
It was not what I was expecting
The movie is just as whacko as the musical and I know the CGI wasn't good 
Music and costumes were beautiful 
I always enjoy a musical. The dancers were fantastic \
