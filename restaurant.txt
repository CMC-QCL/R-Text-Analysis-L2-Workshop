Service was awesome and Jason was very accommodating
I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress
The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems.
We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular
had the wedge salad it was delicious.Â 
interesting menu, wonderful meal that was perfectly served by our waiter
The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing
Although we didn't go into the onsite restaurant, we ordered some food at the bar a few times and it was delicious
I was expecting the food here to follow in the old Southern tradition but was pleased to find the menus trending in a contemporary direction with emphasis on lean, fresh and organic fare
Ordered the crab cake sandwich and was pleased by the quality of the crab cake, as well as the nicely toasted roll, thick slices of ripe avocado, and crisp hot bacon which accompanied it
